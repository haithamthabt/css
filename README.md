-By default without any css your website is responive. This means if you only have html, your website is responsive. The layout will workout on big screens and on small screens. Might not be prettry but the website adapts with the viewport. Despite that images can overflow, but we are not losing any text or anything along the way.
-So after writing some css and runnning into issues, that means that css you wrote is causing the issues. 
- Best practice to write responisve css is to not start with the layoout but is to start with Global stuff; such as cover stuff like typograghy, colors, backgrounds, etc. Then cover the layout
- When working with layout, avoid fixed sizes. Setting fixed hight or fixed width is only gonna cause you problems
