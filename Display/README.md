# Block, Inline, and Inline-Block
This is my notes for using block, inline, and inline-block

## _Display_
The `display` property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

## Block-level Elements
#### _Note_: Most things are blocks (Almost everything is a block)
An example of a block is `<p>`
#### Block level elements always stack on top of each other even if they have room to go next to each other
By default A Block-level element always starts on a new line and have %100 width
#### Examples of block-level elements:
- `<div>`
- `<h1> - <h6>`
- `<p>`
- `<form>`
- `<header>`
- `<footer>`
- `<section>`


## Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
#### Examples of inline elements:
- `<span>`
- `<a>`
- `<img>`



## Display: none;
`display: none;` is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. 
The `<script>` element uses `display: none;` as default.
